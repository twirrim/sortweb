# Sort Visualisation

I thought it'd be interesting to experiment with sort visualisation in rust, using egui to handle turning it in to a web application.

For now, the only sort implemented is Bubble Sort, which is woefully inefficient, as you'll soon seen from the visualisation.

# TODO
* Add other sort algorithms.
* Decide how to represent them.  All in the same page running simultaneously? Button selector to choose which to show? Both?
