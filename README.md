# Sort Visualisation

I thought it'd be interesting to experiment with sort visualisation in rust, using egui to handle turning it in to a web application.

You can see the generated web pages: https://twirrim.github.io/sortweb/

If you clone this source code locally, and run "cargo run --release" it'll run it as a local app, too.

# Implemented sorts
* Bubble
* Shaker
* Insertion
* Shell
* Heap

# TODO
* Add other sort algorithms.
* Decide how to represent them.  All in the same page running simultaneously? Button selector to choose which to show? Both?
